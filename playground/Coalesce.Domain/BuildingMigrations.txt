This is information on how to build migrations.

Be sure that the project.json file has 
  "buildOptions": {
    "emitEntryPoint": true
  },
This is required because of broken tooling for EF migrations. The data project needs to be an executable.
We have had mixed results as to whether it needs to be set back to false after the migration is made.

Note: The database all migrations is based on is named in TemporaryDbContextFactory.
Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=CoalesceDb;Trusted_Connection=True;


To Build a migration using the Package Manager Console:
cd src\coalesce.domain
dotnet ef migrations add [NameOfMigration] -c AppDbContext


To remove all migrations that are not applied to the database:
dotnet ef migrations remove


To update the database manually to the latest migration. This is done by the application at startup.
dotnet ef database update

To update the database manually to the latest migration. Use this to roll back a migration along with the above remove command.
dotnet ef database update [TargetMigrationName]


Running Coalesce:
Run the Coalesce Task Runner Explorer task. Then the TS task to generate the JavaScript from the TypeScript.
